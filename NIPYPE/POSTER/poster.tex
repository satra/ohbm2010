%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    Current neuroimaging software offer users an incredible opportunity
    to analyze their data in different ways, with different underlying
    assumptions. However, this has resulted in a heterogeneous
    collection of specialized applications without transparent
    interoperability or a uniform operating interface. Nipype solves
    these issues by providing a uniform interface to existing
    neuroimaging software and by facilitating interaction between these
    packages within a single workflow.

      \item \textbf{Optimal workflows.} Integrating different packages is tedious.

        disseminating tools across packages.
      \item \textbf{Knowledge distribution.} Training new personnel
        takes time.
      \item \textbf{Leveraging technology.} Many packages do not address
        computational efficiency.
      \item \textbf{Replicating research.} Method sections are often
        inadequate for replication.

    \item \textbf{Minimal programming knowledge.} A high level scripting
      interface to design workflows intended for non-programmers.
    \item \textbf{Parallel execution.} No additional coding necessary
      for parallel execution of processing stages.
    \item \textbf{Pedagogical.} Can be used as a teaching tool and
      facilitates user training.
    \item \textbf{Well documented.} Code documentation becomes user
      documentation.
    \item \textbf{Shared workflows.} Workflows separate execution stages
      from data and can be shared within and across labs.
